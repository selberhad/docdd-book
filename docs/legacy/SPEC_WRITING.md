# Meta-Document: How to Write an Effective SPEC.md

_Analysis of toy model specification methodology and structure based on toy1-3 examples._

---

## What a SPEC.md Actually Is

A **SPEC.md is a comprehensive technical blueprint** that defines **what to build and how it should behave**, serving as both design document and validation contract.

### ❌ What a SPEC.md is NOT:
- **Not implementation code** - no actual class definitions or function bodies
- **Not a user manual** - focuses on system behavior, not user workflows
- **Not a tutorial** - assumes technical competence from implementers
- **Not abbreviated** - comprehensive detail is the goal, not brevity

### ✅ What a SPEC.md IS:
- **Complete behavioral specification** - defines all system inputs, outputs, and state changes
- **Technical contract** - precise enough to validate implementation correctness
- **Design authority** - resolves ambiguity and design questions during development
- **Integration blueprint** - shows how the system fits into larger architecture
- **Validation criteria** - concrete success metrics for implementation testing

## Structure Analysis from Toy Model Specifications

### **Header Section Pattern**
Every effective spec follows this opening structure:
```markdown
# Toy Model N: [System Name] Specification

_Brief tagline describing the system's core purpose._

## Overview
- **What the system does** (core purpose)
- **Key Principles** (design philosophy)
- **Integration context** (how it fits with other systems)
```

### **Data Model Section** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
All three specs include comprehensive data structure definitions:

```javascript
// Example from toy2_spatial_graphs
{
  "nodes": {
    "room1": {
      "id": "room1",
      "label": "entry_hall", 
      "geometry": {
        "x": -8.5, "y": -8.5,
        "width": 17, "height": 17,
        "area": 289,
        "type": "rectangle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Pattern**: Show complete, realistic data structures with:
- All required fields
- Realistic values (not just "string" or "number")
- Nested structures fully expanded
- Comments explaining field purposes

### **Operations Section** ⭐ **CRITICAL**
Detailed command/operation specifications with consistent format:

#### Command Template:
```markdown
#### `command_name <required> [optional]`
Brief description of what this command does.

**Syntax:**
```
command_name param1 param2 --flag value
```

**Parameters:**
- `<param1>`: Description with valid values/ranges
- `[optional]`: Description with defaults

**Examples:**
```
command_name example1
command_name example2 --advanced-usage
```

**Behavior:**
- What the command does step-by-step
- State changes and side effects
- Return values or outputs

**Validation:**
- Input validation rules
- Error conditions
- Edge case handling
```

### **Internal State Structures** ⭐ **ESSENTIAL**
Detailed specification of internal data formats:
- How data is stored in memory
- State transitions and updates
- Relationships between data structures
- Event logging and history tracking

### **Test Scenarios Section** ⭐ **VALIDATION FOCUS**
Comprehensive test scenarios that serve multiple purposes:

#### **Pattern 1: Progressive Complexity**
```markdown
### Scenario 1: Simple Case
**Input:** Basic operation
**Expected Output:** Clear, predictable result

### Scenario 2: Realistic Usage  
**Input:** Real-world complexity
**Expected Output:** Handles complexity correctly

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
**Input:** Invalid/edge cases
**Expected Output:** Graceful error handling
```

#### **Pattern 2: Integration Testing**
Shows how the system works with other components:
- Import/export with other toy models
- Data format compatibility
- End-to-end workflows

### **Success Criteria Section** ⭐ **ACCEPTANCE TESTING**
Four-category validation framework used across all specs:

```markdown

- [ ] Core functionality works correctly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive

### [Domain] Validation  
- [ ] Domain-specific requirements (geographic, spatial, narrative)

## Specification Quality Indicators

### **High-Quality Specifications Include:**

#### ✅ **Complete Data Structure Definitions**
```javascript
// Good: Complete, realistic structure
{
  "cursor": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "current_room": "room1"},
  "rooms": {
    "room1": {
      "id": "room1",
      "label": "entry_hall",
      "x": -8.5, "y": -8.5,
      "width": 17, "height": 17
    }
  }
}

// Bad: Vague or incomplete
{
  "data": "object with room information",
  "state": "current system state"
}
```

#### ✅ **Comprehensive Command Specifications**
```markdown
# Good: Complete command specification
#### `walk <cells> <direction>`
Move the planning cursor by specified number of cells.

**Parameters:**
- `<cells>`: Positive integer number of cells (3-pace increments)
- `<direction>`: `north` | `south` | `east` | `west`

**Examples:**
```
walk 7 north        # Move 21 paces (7 cells) north
walk 3 east         # Move 9 paces (3 cells) east
```

**Validation:**
- `<cells>` must be positive integer
- `<direction>` must be valid cardinal direction

# Bad: Incomplete command specification  
#### `walk`
Move the cursor around.
```

#### ✅ **Realistic Test Scenarios**
```markdown
# Good: Comprehensive scenario
### Scenario 2: L-Shaped Building
**Input:**
```
walk 7 north
stake room 17 17 north center
label entry_hall  
stake wing 10 east
```

**Expected Output:**
- Three connected rooms forming L-shape
- Entry hall with entrances/exits properly connected
- Wings properly sized and positioned

# Bad: Vague scenario
### Test Case
Run some commands and check they work.
```

#### ✅ **Detailed Error Specifications**
```markdown
# Good: Specific error handling
Error: Room overlap detected for 'stake room 20 20 north center'
       Proposed room (x:-30 y:21 w:60 h:60) overlaps with room2 (x:-25 y:0 w:50 h:50)

# Bad: Generic error handling
Error: Operation failed
```

### **Low-Quality Specifications Lack:**

#### ❌ **Vague Behavioral Descriptions**
```markdown
# Bad: Too abstract
The system processes spatial data and performs operations.

# Good: Specific behavior
The spatial graph operations system takes blueprint data and applies 
graph mutations, aggregation rules, and geometric transformations while
preserving connectivity and spatial relationships.
```

#### ❌ **Missing Integration Details**
```markdown
# Bad: No integration context
This system works with other tools.

# Good: Specific integration
Compatible with spatial-blueprints package through GeoJSON import/export.
Integrates with Toy Model 1 blueprint parser via JSON data exchange.
```

#### ❌ **Incomplete Data Specifications**
```markdown
# Bad: Minimal data definition
rooms: object containing room data

# Good: Complete data structure
"rooms": {
  "room1": {
    "id": "room1",
    "label": "entry_hall",
    "x": -8.5, "y": -8.5,
    "width": 17, "height": 17,
    "entrances": ["south"],
    "exits": {"east": "room2", "west": "room3"}
  }
}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Implementation Leakage**
**Wrong:** Including implementation details in specification
```markdown
The system uses a Python dictionary to store room data with
NetworkX graphs for connectivity analysis.
```

**Right:** Focus on behavioral specification
```markdown
The system maintains room connectivity through bidirectional
associations, enabling path-finding and reachability analysis.
```

### **❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Insufficient Detail**
**Wrong:** Vague command descriptions
```markdown
#### `aggregate`
Apply aggregation rules to rooms.
```

**Right:** Complete behavioral specification
```markdown
#### `aggregate <rules> [scope]`
Apply aggregation rules to convert cell-based layouts into realistic room counts.

**Built-in Rules:**
- `indoor_standard`: 1-4 cells per room, prefers 2-3
- `outdoor_large`: 25-100 cells per room, prefers 50-75

**Examples:**
```
aggregate indoor_standard             # Apply to all interior rooms
aggregate outdoor_large --scope yard_* # Only to courtyard areas
```
```

### **❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Missing Integration Context**
**Wrong:** Isolated system description
```markdown
This tool processes spatial data independently.
```

**Right:** Clear integration architecture
```markdown
Import/export compatible with spatial-blueprints package.
Integrates with Toy Model 1 via JSON blueprint data.
Output suitable for game engine room generation.
```

### **❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Weak Validation Criteria**
**Wrong:** Vague success metrics
```markdown
- [ ] System works correctly
- [ ] No major bugs
- [ ] Good performance
```

**Right:** Specific, testable criteria
```markdown
- [ ] All operations preserve graph connectivity
- [ ] Transformations maintain geometric correctness  
- [ ] Performance acceptable for 100+ node graphs
- [ ] Round-trip operations preserve essential structure
```
