# Toy5 Outdoor Integration - Experiment Learnings

*Key insights from three spatial reasoning experiments with LLM-based world generation*

---

## Experiment 1: Hierarchical Subdivision (Complete Success ✅)

### Core Learning: Compound Quadrant Handling
**Problem**: LLM parser returned compound quadrants ("NE|SE", "NW|SW") causing semantic splitting to create 0 regions despite correct parsing.
**Solution**: Added compound quadrant handling in `extract_quadrant_splits()` function.
**Insight**: LLMs naturally think in compound spatial terms - the parser must accommodate this rather than force artificial constraints.

### Critical Discovery: Environment Variable Consistency
**Issue**: `WDB_USE_LLM=1` environment variable inconsistency caused complete failure.
**Impact**: Semantic splitting was non-functional without proper LLM mode activation.
**Learning**: Environment variable passing must be validated throughout the entire call stack, not just at entry points.

### Hierarchical Progression Pattern
**Finding**: Required 3 reports to achieve full subdivision (not 2 as planned).
- Report A+B: Achieved proper east/west split with NE refinement
- Report C: Required additional western refinement to complete subdivision
**Insight**: Adaptive report sequences are necessary - fixed iteration counts don't match natural spatial reasoning patterns.

### Scale-Dependent Reporting Challenges
**Discovery**: Different strategies needed for different subdivision levels.
- Size-8 → Size-4 → Size-2: Works well with directional reports
- Size-2 → Size-1: Needs more targeted individual leaf addressing
**Learning**: Spatial reasoning strategies must adapt to scale - what works for regions doesn't work for individual locations.

## Experiment 2: Geographic Constraint System (Incomplete - Pivoted)

### Problem Definition Framework
**Questions Identified**:
- How to define "reasonable" terrain transitions (forest↔grassland vs forest↔ocean)
- What radius should spatial context queries use (scale-dependent approach)
- Should constraints be strict rules or probabilistic guidance
- How to handle sparse terrain coverage areas
- User experience for constraint violations

### Terrain Transition Rules Insight
**Valid Pattern**: "The forest continues eastward with denser undergrowth near the stream"
**Invalid Pattern**: "Found a vast desert stretching beyond the known forest boundaries"
**Refinable Pattern**: "Discovered ruins in the northern wilderness" → needs terrain context

**Learning**: Constraint validation requires explicit terrain compatibility matrices and context-aware rules rather than just adjacency checking.

### Phase-Based Implementation Strategy
**Approach**: Break complex geographic constraint systems into incremental phases:
1. Spatial context query system
2. Basic constraint validation
3. LLM-integrated iterative refinement
4. Conflict resolution strategies
5. CLI integration

**Insight**: Geographic consistency is too complex for monolithic implementation - requires systematic, testable building blocks.

## Experiment 3: Scout Path Iteration (Critical Breakthrough ✅)

### Major Discovery: Local LLM Quality Issues vs Prompting Strategy

#### Initial Failure: LLM Reliability Problems
**Problem**: Local LLM (llama3.2:latest) showing severe reliability issues:
- **Terrain Hallucination**: Fabricated coastlines and cliffs from forest descriptions
- **Format Inconsistency**: Quadrant format varied unpredictably
- **JSON Structure Violations**: Broke parsing pipeline
- **Spatial Impossibility**: Generated terrain contradicted source narrative

**Initial Assessment**: 0% accuracy, concluded 7B models insufficient for spatial reasoning.

#### Breakthrough: Constrained Prompting Strategy
**Solution**: Complete prompting redesign:
- **Single task focus**: Extract only directional terrain, not complex structures
- **Constrained vocabulary**: Only 5 terrain types (forest, grassland, hills, desert, water)
- **Clear examples**: Show exact expected JSON format
- **Explicit rules**: "Do NOT invent terrain not mentioned in the text"
- **Temperature 0.0**: Deterministic output for consistency

#### Results: Night and Day Improvement
**Before**: Hallucinated coastlines and cliffs from "ancient forest" input
**After**: Accurate terrain mapping with zero hallucinations

**Critical Learning**: **Model capability is heavily dependent on prompting strategy**. The same 7B model went from 0% accuracy to reliable spatial reasoning with better constraints.

### Integration Issue Discovery: Silent System Failures

#### The Format Compatibility Bug
**Problem**: Semantic regions created successfully but quadtree integration silently failed.
**Root Cause**: Format mismatch between WDB v2 JSON format and QuadtreeSystem deserialization expectations.
- WDB v2: `"leaves": [leaf_array]` with `"root_bounds"`
- QuadtreeSystem: `"leaves": {leaf_dict}` with `"world_bounds"`

**Impact**: System appeared functional while geographic context queries returned "unknown terrain."

**Critical Learning**: **Silent integration failures are more dangerous than obvious failures**. Always validate complete data flow, not just individual components.

### Core Hypothesis Validation: Constraint-Based Spatial Reasoning

#### Successful Geographic Consistency
**Finding**: LLMs can maintain spatial consistency when provided with contextual constraints from their own previous outputs.

**Evidence**: Scout path iteration showed:
- **Boundary consistency**: Forest-grassland division maintained across 5 positions
- **Transitional logic**: Descriptions evolved naturally from "distant meadows" to "standing in grassland"
- **Directional stability**: "Forest to the northeast" remained accurate throughout journey

**Insight**: Geographic constraint injection creates **emergent spatial reasoning** rather than just preventing errors.

### Bidirectional Pipeline Architecture Success

#### Self-Reinforcing Feedback Loop
**Architecture**: Context → Narrative → Context creates self-reinforcing consistency.
**Result**: Each scout report builds upon and validates prior spatial knowledge.
**Learning**: World-building systems should prioritize **consistency mechanisms over content generation capabilities**.

## Cross-Experiment Synthesis

### Model Capability Insights

#### Local LLMs Are Sufficient With Proper Design
**Key Factors for Success**:
- **Temperature 0.0**: Deterministic output prevents drift
- **Constrained vocabulary**: Limited terrain types reduce hallucination
- **Clear examples**: Show exact expected format
- **Explicit prohibitions**: "Do NOT invent" rules prevent unwanted creativity

**Implication**: Advanced spatial reasoning doesn't require large cloud models - it requires sophisticated prompt engineering.

### Infrastructure Design Principles

#### Trust But Verify Integration Points
**Pattern**: The most valuable debugging effort focuses on integration boundaries.
**Lesson**: Build comprehensive integration tests that validate complete data flow, not just individual function outputs.

#### Environment Variable Consistency
**Learning**: Configuration must be validated throughout the entire execution stack.
**Best Practice**: Explicit environment variable passing rather than implicit inheritance.

### Spatial Reasoning Architecture

#### Constraint Over Creativity
**Finding**: For systematic world-building, LLM creativity is a bug, not a feature.
**Insight**: Predictability and constraint adherence matter more than narrative richness for consistent world generation.

#### Scale-Dependent Strategies
**Learning**: Spatial reasoning approaches must adapt to scale:
- Region-level: Directional descriptions work well
- Location-level: Requires targeted individual addressing
- Feature-level: Needs specific constraint validation

#### Hierarchical Progression Patterns
**Insight**: Natural spatial subdivision doesn't follow rigid patterns - systems must adapt to emergent complexity rather than forcing predetermined structures.
