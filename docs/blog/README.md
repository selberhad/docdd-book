A collection of essays on software development, AI, and engineering practices.

## Articles

### [Doc Driven Development in the Age of AI](Doc%20Driven%20Development.md)
An AI-first methodology where documentation becomes the primary artifact and code becomes disposable. Explores how to leverage AI assistants through a cycle of docs → tests → implementation → learnings, using "napkin physics" and toy models to extract durable insights.

### [CLI + JSON as Debugger: Giving LLM Agents Deterministic Legs](CLI%20JSON%20Debugging.md)
A practical approach to building AI-debuggable systems using CLI tools that expose every step of execution in machine-readable JSON format. Shows how deterministic I/O gives LLM agents transparent, falsifiable state to reason over.

### [Guidance Vectors: Compact Spells for Steering LLMs](Guidance%20Vectors.md)
Explores how short phrases can carry enough latent meaning to shift LLM behavior into useful modes of reasoning. Introduces concepts like "Chomskyian concision" and "Einsteinian simplicity" as compact incantations for steering model output.

### [The Over-Engineering Epidemic: How Modern Development Tools Are Slowing Us Down](The%20Over-Engineering%20Epidemic.md)
A critique of modern development practices that prioritize complex tooling and abstractions over clarity and simplicity. Argues against TypeScript overhead, premature abstraction, and AI-generated boilerplate in favor of direct, understandable code.

### [Fast Fashion Code: The Hidden Environmental Cost of AI-Generated Garbage](Fast%20Fashion%20Code.md)
Examines the environmental impact of AI-generated code, drawing parallels between fast fashion and the current trend of generating low-quality, disposable code. Advocates for a "Slow Code" ethic that prioritizes building less but building better.

### [Shipping My First Fully AI‑Coded Project](First%20Vibecoded%20Project.md)
A hands-on account of building and shipping a complete project where AI handled all implementation while the human focused on product direction, UX decisions, and testing. Demonstrates the practical application of human-AI collaboration through the development of a ChatGPT export viewer toolkit.

### [Vibe-writing the DocDD Book](Vibewriting.md)
How the DocDD book was produced through "vibe-writing": agents draft, restructure, and refactor while the human edits for clarity, constraints, and voice. Connects the methodology’s dual modes (Discovery for uncertainty, Execution for delivery) to long-form writing, showing agent-first operations beyond code.
