# Guidance Vectors: Compact Spells for Steering LLMs

LLMs are vast, tangled latent spaces. Prompts don’t issue commands so much as **nudge the model into a subspace** where certain habits of thought dominate. A short phrase can carry enough latent meaning to shift the trajectory of output.  

I call these **Guidance Vectors**: compact incantations that steer the model into useful modes of reasoning.

## Why Guidance Vectors Work

LLMs have absorbed enormous amounts of cultural and technical discourse. Names and phrases come loaded with associations to styles of thought. Invoking them activates those associations — like calling a function whose implementation is latent in the model’s weights.  

Think of them as **spells**: dense verbal glyphs that reframe the model’s posture.  

- **Conceptual anchors**: tie the model to a stance.  
- **Latent triggers**: evoke stylistic templates.  
- **Meta-constraints**: direct awareness of what to avoid.  
- **Cultural allusions**: shortcut verbose instructions with archetypes.

## The Chomskyian and the Einsteinian

Two vectors that keep surfacing in our work:

- **Chomskyian concision**: Chomsky has critiqued “concision” in media as a negative — forcing arguments into soundbite form that excludes complexity. The irony is that his own style embodies a *positive* concision: maximal density of reasoning, zero filler. Invoking “Chomskyian” puts the model in that mode.  

- **Einsteinian simplicity**: Einstein famously said, *“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”* This isn’t minimalism for its own sake, but the physics ideal: parsimony without distortion. Invoking “Einsteinian” keeps specs and plans pared down without collapsing nuance.  

Together, these two vectors balance density with clarity: no wasted words, but also no premature truncation.

## Other Emerging Vectors

- **Alchemical framing** → Human reframing changes system behavior reflexively.  
- **Single axis of complexity** → Each toy model explores one variable only.  

Each phrase acts as a **posture of thought**: not new rules, but a shift in context that changes output.

## Why This Matters

For AI-first development, verbosity is poison. Overly long prompts confuse; vague prompts invite hallucination. Guidance Vectors are the middle path: compact shorthand that keeps the model aligned.  

They also form a **shared lexicon**. Humans and agents can both reference the same terms to enforce consistency across cycles of planning, specification, and integration.

## Closing Thought

If [Doc Driven Development](Doc%20Driven%20Development.md) flips the cost structure of software — making code cheap and clarity durable — then Guidance Vectors are the rhetorical substrate that makes that clarity possible.  

They’re not just prompts. They’re **steering glyphs for latent space**: compact, powerful, and reusable.
