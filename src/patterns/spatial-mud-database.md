# Case Study II

## Spatial MUD Database - Ongoing Research

This case study documents the application of DocDD to a novel, technically complex database system for spatial reasoning in text-based virtual worlds. Unlike the Archive Browser's web tooling focus, this project explores DocDD's effectiveness with:

- **Complex algorithmic challenges**: LLM-guided hierarchical world subdivision
- **AI collaboration patterns**: Constraint-based spatial reasoning with local models
- **Integration with legacy systems**: Eventual integration with Evennia MUD framework

## Key Technical Insights

**Constrained Vocabulary Success**: Local LLMs (7B models) achieved reliable spatial reasoning when provided with limited terrain vocabularies and explicit anti-hallucination rules, contradicting initial assumptions about model capability requirements.

**Silent Integration Failures**: The most dangerous bugs were format compatibility issues between components that appeared to work individually but failed silently in integration. Comprehensive data flow validation became essential.

**Adaptive Iteration Patterns**: Natural spatial subdivision required flexible progression (3 reports instead of planned 2) rather than rigid iteration counts, demonstrating the need for responsive rather than predetermined development cycles.

## Methodology Validation

The toy model discipline proved effective under genuine technical complexity through three focused experiments:

- **Toy5a (Hierarchical Subdivision)**: Validated semantic world splitting with LLM guidance
- **Toy5b (Geographic Constraints)**: Explored (then pivoted from) complex constraint systems
- **Toy5c (Scout Path Iteration)**: Achieved breakthrough in bidirectional spatial consistency

Each toy isolated specific technical risks while maintaining the four-document discipline (SPEC, PLAN, README, LEARNINGS), proving DocDD's scalability beyond simple web tooling projects.

## Production Readiness

The spatial database demonstrates DocDD's effectiveness for "novel technically complex greenfield work" - the core AYYUS hypothesis has been validated for production applications including agent-driven exploration, multiplayer world-building, and autonomous map generation.

**Next Phase**: Integration toys with Evennia framework to test DocDD's legacy integration capabilities.
