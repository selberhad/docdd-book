# Examples Archive

This archive lists concrete, working examples referenced by the v2 chapters. It is intentionally small and current.

## Plan (Example/Template) — Archive Browser, Stage 1
Summary
- Demonstrates a real PLAN.md for Stage 1 of an "Archive Browser" kickoff.
- Two primitives (Toy A + Toy B):
  - Toy A — ZIP metadata reader: golden output, error cases, determinism, central directory only.
  - Toy B — TUI list: startup, stress, and error behavior; non‑blocking and clean exit.
- Includes precise tests, implementation constraints, and success criteria for each step.

Open the full example: [Plan (Example/Template)](./examples/plan.md)

Notes
- Keep examples practical and minimal; link them from relevant chapters.
- Export formats: when useful, include small JSON/DOT/CSV snippets alongside examples.
