# Introduction

## A Note on Audience and Style

This book is written primarily for AI agents, not humans.

The language is denser, more precise, and less conversational than typical technical writing. Concepts are compressed. Examples are minimal. There are no "TL;DR" sections.

This is a deliberate choice for the AI era. If you're a human reader finding the text challenging:

**Don't simplify the book. Augment yourself.**

Point your AI agent at this book (Claude Code, Cursor, or any agent with file access) and discuss it conversationally. Ask for explanations in your preferred style. Request examples tailored to your context. Have the AI expand sections you find dense.

The book optimizes for agent parsing and recall, not human reading comfort. Agents can then translate for humans as needed.

**TL;DR is a pre-AI anachronism.** Dense documentation + conversational AI > dumbed-down documentation for everyone.

With that framing established, let's begin.
