# DocDD Loop & Kickoff (New Edition)

Condensed “how”: the Docs → Tests → Impl loop and the binary‑weave kickoff pattern, focused on sequencing and integration without repetition.

- Reference: [Playbook](../../playbooks/playbook.md) and [Kickoff Writing](../../guides/writing/kickoff.md)
- Consolidate: keep the loop once here; cross‑link to Foundations for principles.
