# Debugger Mindset (New Edition)

Why: make execution legible and falsifiable. Prefer pure CLIs with JSON I/O so steps are deterministic and inspectable by humans.

- Reference: [CLI + JSON as Debugger](../../guides/debuggers.md)
- Consolidate: highlight “why” and practical trade‑offs; keep the contract simple.
