# Doc‑Driven Development — Principles (New Edition)

Why DDD first: prioritize clarity and constraints; treat code as the minimum to satisfy tests. This chapter reframes the protocol for humans, not agents.

- Reference: current chapter [Doc‑Driven Development (DDD)](../../guides/ddd.md)
- Consolidate: move complexity heuristics and guardrails here; avoid repeating the loop from Playbook.
