# Napkin Physics (New Edition)

Why: upstream simplification to prevent scope drift. Capture problem, assumptions, invariant, mechanism, and first try before writing detailed docs.

- Reference: Napkin Physics section in [Playbook](../../playbooks/playbook.md)
- Consolidate: include examples and antiâ€‘patterns; keep it short and actionable.
