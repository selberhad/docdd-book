# README Writing

Purpose
- Context refresh for internal libraries/modules so humans and agents can orient quickly.

Required structure
1) Header + one‑liner: library_name and concise description.
2) Purpose (2–3 sentences): problem, approach/pattern, integration role.
3) Key API (3–5 methods with type hints): most important first.
4) Core concepts: data structures/abstractions, constraints, integrations, patterns.
5) Gotchas & caveats: limitations, common mistakes, perf considerations, integration pitfalls.
6) Quick test: representative test to run.

Writing guidelines
- Be concise (bullets), specific (real signatures, constraints), and practical (what to know to use correctly). Avoid marketing and deep implementation details.

Template and quality check
- Use the provided template; ensure a reader can grasp purpose in 10 seconds, know primary methods, avoid mistakes, and validate via quick test.
