# Learnings Writing

Purpose
- Capture architectural insights from experiments: what worked, what failed, what remains uncertain, and why.

What it is / is not
- Not: feature list, implementation details, user manual, hype without evidence.
- Is: validated insights, failures/limitations, open questions, pointers to reuse, calibration for future work.

Essential sections
- Header: System Name – Learnings; Duration | Status | Estimate.
- Summary: Built (1 line); Worked (1–2 successes); Failed (1–2 failures); Uncertain (open question).
- Evidence: Validated (finding with evidence); Challenged (difficulty, workaround, lesson); Failed (explicit dead end); Uncertain (still unresolved).
- Pivots: Original approach → New approach; why; unknowns.
- Impact: reusable patterns/assets; architectural consequences; estimate calibration.

Style
- Short, factual, bullet‑heavy; note failures/unknowns explicitly; one page max.
