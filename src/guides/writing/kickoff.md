# KICKOFF_WRITING.md — Guide for Binary-Weave Kickoff Docs

This document instructs the agent how to write a **KICKOFF.md** for a new DocDD project.  
The goal is to produce a single, explicit binary-weave plan — not a flat list of toys, not parallel streams.  
The weave always alternates: *new primitive → integration with prior product*.

## Core Shape of a Kickoff

1. **Napkin Physics**:  
   - Problem (1 sentence)  
   - Assumptions (3–5 bullets)  
   - Invariant (one crisp property that must always hold)  
   - Mechanism (≤5 bullets describing the minimal path)  

2. **Binary-Weave Plan**:  
   - Always introduce **one new primitive at a time** (Toy A, Toy B, Toy C …).  
   - Always follow by **integrating it with the prior product** (A+B=C, C+D=E, …).  
   - Each integration produces the **new “current product”**.  
   - No step introduces more than one new primitive.  
   - No integration combines more than two things.  
   - Continue until the final product emerges.  

3. **End State**:  
   - Name the final product.  
   - Summarize which primitives and integrations were woven.  
   - State the durable invariants.  
   - Clarify that only the final docs + system remain; toys are discarded but learnings are kept.

## Formatting Expectations

- **Stage numbering is sequential.**  
  - *Stage 1*: Primitive A, Primitive B  
  - *Stage 2*: A + B = C  
  - *Stage 3*: Primitive D  
  - *Stage 4*: C + D = E  
  - *Stage 5*: Primitive F  
  - *Stage 6*: E + F = G  
  - …continue until final product.  

- **Each stage entry must have**:  
  - **Name** (Toy or Integration)  
  - **What it does** (one sentence)  
  - **Invariant** (instantaneous, non-blocking, etc.)  

- **Avoid parallel numbering.** Don’t list “Stage 2.3” or “Stage 2.4”.  
- **Avoid over-specification.** The kickoff is a weave map, not a spec.  
- **Avoid skipping.** Each stage should follow the weave pattern strictly.

## Tone & Style

- Write plainly and compactly — scaffolding, not prose.  
- Prioritize clarity of the weave over detail of implementation.  
- Keep invariants crisp and behavioral, not vague.  
- Use ≤2 bullets per primitive/integration when possible.

## One-Shot Checklist

- [ ] Napkin Physics included?  
- [ ] Sequential stages?  
- [ ] Exactly one new primitive per stage?  
- [ ] Integration always combines current product with one new primitive?  
- [ ] Final product and invariants stated at end?  

If all are checked, the kickoff is valid.
